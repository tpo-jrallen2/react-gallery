# Treehouse Unit 7 Project: React Gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project

This project interacts with the Flickr API to fetch photo data and display it on the page. 

The user can select from preset topics or search for their own. 

Base styling provided by Treehouse, however I did alter some colors and backgrounds on the static elements. 

## Flickr API Key Needed

To run this project you will need your own 'config.js' file in the src directory containing your own Flickr API key.
